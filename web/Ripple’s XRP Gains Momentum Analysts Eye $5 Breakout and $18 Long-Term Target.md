## Technical Outlook: Elliott Wave Theory and Key Price Levels  

XRP‚Äôs recent price action aligns with Elliott Wave Theory, a widely used framework for predicting market trends. Analysts suggest that XRP has completed its fourth wave in the intermediate cycle and is now entering its fifth wave, which historically corresponds with significant price surges.  

### Intermediate Cycle: $5.85 Target  
Dark Defender, a prominent crypto analyst, mapped XRP‚Äôs projected path using Elliott Wave principles. The analysis indicates that the asset is poised for a surge to **$5.85** during the fifth wave. This level represents a critical juncture for traders, as breaking above it could validate a broader bullish trend.  

### Long-Term Projection: $18.22  
Extending the Elliott Wave analysis to a larger timeframe, the theory suggests a long-term target of **$18.22**. This projection, rooted in historical price patterns, assumes XRP will consolidate before entering a powerful upward trend. The hypothesis has remained consistent since mid-2023, with current price stability around **$0.40‚Äì$0.50** aligning with the model‚Äôs expectations.  

### Resistance and Support Levels  
- **Short-Term Resistance**: $2.70  
  A breakout above $2.70 would signal strong buyer conviction and potentially accelerate gains toward $3.30 and $5.  
- **Critical Support**: $2.50  
  A drop below $2.50 could trigger short-term selling pressure, testing lower support zones at $2.00 and $1.60. However, substantial buy-side liquidity beneath $2.50 suggests active defense of this level.

## Market Sentiment and Investor Activity  

Despite recent volatility, XRP‚Äôs market sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish. Exchange inflows have surged, with over **$15 million worth of XRP** moving onto centralized exchanges, reflecting heightened trading activity.  

### Futures Market Dynamics  
Negative funding rates in XRP‚Äôs futures market indicate bearish positioning by traders, anticipating price declines. However, historical patterns show that such conditions often precede sharp recoveries, as aggressive short positions can catalyze a **short squeeze**, propelling prices upward.  

### Liquidity Walls and Volatility  
A notable liquidity wall beneath $2.50 suggests institutional buyers are accumulating at this level. This support mechanism increases the likelihood of a sustained rebound, particularly if XRP maintains above $2.45.

## Trump‚Äôs Truth.Fi ETF: A Catalyst for XRP Adoption?  

The launch of Trump Media‚Äôs **Truth.Fi ETF** has sparked speculation about XRP‚Äôs potential inclusion in a U.S.-focused digital asset fund. The ETF aims to counter ESG-driven investment strategies by prioritizing American-centric assets, including cryptocurrencies.  

### Key Components of Truth.Fi ETF  
1. **Made in America ETF**: Targets U.S.-based crypto firms, with XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and USDC under consideration.  
2. **U.S. Energy Independence ETF**: Aligns with Trump‚Äôs pro-energy policies.  
3. **Bitcoin Plus ETF**: Reflects Trump‚Äôs growing affinity for Bitcoin and decentralized finance.  

Devin Nunes, TMTG Chairman, emphasized the ETF‚Äôs mission to challenge ‚Äúwoke finance,‚Äù positioning it as a ideological alternative to mainstream investment vehicles. If XRP is included, it could attract institutional inflows and solidify its position as a mainstream digital asset.
