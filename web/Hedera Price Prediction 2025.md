## Technical Indicators and Price Projections for 2025  

### Short-Term Volatility and Resistance Levels  
In May 2025, HBAR trades near **$0.18**, reflecting a consolidation phase after earlier fluctuations. Analysts identify critical resistance levels at **$0.20**, **$0.258**, **$0.32**, and **$0.37**. Breaking through $0.20 could trigger a bullish rally, while failure to sustain momentum might retest support at **$0.16** or **$0.124**.  

The "death cross" patternâ€”a bearish signal when short-term moving averages fall below long-term onesâ€”remains a concern for short-term traders. However, the 4-hour chart suggests a narrow trading channel, indicating market indecision rather than a definitive trend.
