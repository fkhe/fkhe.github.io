## Historical Context and Implementation

As the world's first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador's journey began with strategic acquisitions at pivotal market moments. The government initiated its Bitcoin purchase program in September 2021 at approximately **$30,000 per BTC**, gradually building a diversified digital asset portfolio. Current market valuation places these holdings at a **28% average increase** above acquisition cost.

| Purchase Phase | Bitcoin Price | Quantity Purchased | Acquisition Cost |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Initial Batch  | $30,000       | 400 BTC            | $12M             |
| Subsequent Buys| $20,000-$25,000| 1,600 BTC          | $38M             |
| Current Value  | $28,000+      | 2,000 BTC          | $56M+            |

## Economic Rationale Behind Crypto Adoption

President Nayib Bukele's administration continues to champion Bitcoin integration for several strategic reasons:

1. **Financial Inclusion**: Over 70% of Salvadoran citizens previously lacked access to traditional banking services
2. **Remittance Optimization**: The country receives approximately **$6 billion annually** in overseas remittances
3. **Tourism & Commerce**: Bitcoin-enabled transactions reduce cross-border payment costs by up to 50%
