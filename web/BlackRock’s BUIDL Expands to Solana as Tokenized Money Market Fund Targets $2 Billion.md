## Why Solana? A Strategic Move for Scalability  

BlackRock‚Äôs decision to integrate Solana reflects the network‚Äôs rising prominence in the blockchain sector. Known for its **high throughput (65,000+ transactions per second)** and **low fees ($0.00025 per transaction)**, Solana offers a scalable infrastructure ideal for institutional-grade applications.  

### Solana vs. Ethereum: A Comparative Analysis  

| Feature               | Solana                          | Ethereum                        |  
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| Transaction Speed     | 65,000+ TPS                     | ~15-45 TPS                      |  
| Average Fee           | $0.00025                        | $0.50‚Äì$20 (gas-dependent)       |  
| Ecosystem Growth      | Rapidly expanding DeFi and Web3   | Mature smart contract platform  |

## The Rise of Tokenization: Transforming Financial Assets  

Tokenization‚Äîthe process of representing off-chain assets like bonds or stocks on a blockchain‚Äîis revolutionizing finance. BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL exemplifies this trend by digitizing money market funds, which traditionally serve as safe-haven investments.

## Competing with Stablecoins: The Yield Advantage  

Stablecoins like **USDT** and **USDC** have long dominated the crypto market as digital cash equivalents. However, their lack of yield generation creates an opportunity for products like BUIDL.

2. **No fiat conversion required**: Investors avoid the friction of swapping crypto for fiat.  
3. **Regulatory alignment**: Backed by BlackRock‚Äôs institutional credibility, BUIDL mitigates counterparty risks.  

Other financial giants are following suit:  
- **Franklin Templeton** launched a blockchain-based money-market fund in 2024.  
- **Figure Markets** secured SEC approval for an interest-bearing stablecoin in February 2025.
