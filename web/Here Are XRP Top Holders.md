### Centralization Concerns  

XRP‚Äôs concentration among a few entities has sparked debates about decentralization. Critics argue that Ripple‚Äôs escrow structure could enable price manipulation, with financial analyst Rajat Soni labeling XRP a ‚Äúscam‚Äù due to its centralized tokenomics. However, Ripple does not control the **XRP Ledger**, which operates via a decentralized validator network. Any ledger modifications require consensus, preventing unilateral changes.
