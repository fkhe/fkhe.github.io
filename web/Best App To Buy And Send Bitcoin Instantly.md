## Understanding Instant Bitcoin Transactions  

The term "instant" in Bitcoin transactions often refers to the **user experience** rather than the technical reality of blockchain confirmations. While the Bitcoin network typically requires 10 minutes per block confirmation, modern apps leverage innovative solutions to minimize perceived delays:  

- **Lightning Network**: A Layer-2 protocol enabling near-instant, low-cost transactions.  
- **Custodial Transfers**: Platforms like Cash App allow instant internal transfers by acting as intermediaries.  
- **Pre-Funded Wallets**: Some services pre-load liquidity to bypass blockchain wait times.  

### FAQ: How Does the Lightning Network Work?  
The Lightning Network operates as a secondary layer atop the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing users to open payment channels and transact instantly without waiting for block confirmations. This reduces congestion on the main chain and slashes fees.

## Evaluating Security and Speed in Crypto Apps
