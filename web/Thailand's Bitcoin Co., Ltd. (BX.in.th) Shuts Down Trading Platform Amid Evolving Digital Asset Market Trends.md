# Thailand's Bitcoin Co., Ltd. (BX.in.th) Shuts Down Trading Platform Amid Evolving Digital Asset Market Trends  

## Market Still Shows Liquidity Despite Exchange Closure  

In September 2019, Thailand's Bitcoin Co., Ltd. (BX.in.th), once the fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in the country, announced its closure effective September 30, 2019. While this marked a significant event in the Thai crypto sector, the digital asset market continues to demonstrate resilience.  

According to data from [Coin Dance](https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/THB), Thailand's Bitcoin daily trading volume averaged THB 16.1 million in August 2019. Though modest compared to traditional financial markets, this represented a 23.3% year-on-year increase from 2018. While the figure remains below the speculative peaks of 2017, the upward trajectory suggests a gradual recovery and sustained interest in digital assets among Thai investors.

## Regulatory Landscape and Market Adaptation  

Despite BX.in.th's exit, Thailand's regulatory framework continues to support market development. At the time of the announcement, two licensed exchanges remained operational, with expectations of increased trading volume as market participants migrate. Additionally, two new platforms had secured licenses from Thailand's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with plans to launch by year-end. Over 16 pending applications further indicate robust interest in establishing compliant digital asset businesses.  

This evolving ecosystem aligns with the Thai SEC's structured licensing approach, which now requires operators to obtain distinct permits for different services. This regulatory rigor aims to foster institutional-grade platforms capable of offering diversified financial products beyond basic trading.  

## Strategic Shifts in Digital Asset Business Models  

Kasikorn Research Center highlights a transformative shift in digital asset business strategies. The future landscape will likely see exchanges expanding into ancillary services such as:  
- **Digital asset brokerage**  
- **ICO/STO project selection**  
- **P2P payment solutions via blockchain wallets**  

This mirrors trends in traditional fintech, where integrated platforms provide seamless financial services. A notable milestone occurred in early 2019 when a new operator secured dual licenses for exchange operations and brokerage services - a first in Thailand's digital asset sector.
