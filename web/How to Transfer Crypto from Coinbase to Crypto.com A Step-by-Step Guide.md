## Understanding the Transfer Process  

Before initiating a transfer, it's crucial to understand the technical requirements:  
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Ensure both platforms support the cryptocurrency you're transferring

## Step 1: Prepare Your Crypto.com Wallet  

Begin by accessing your Crypto.com account through the mobile app or website:  

1. Navigate to **Wallet > Deposit > Cryptocurrency**

## Transfer Verification Times  

| Blockchain | Average Confirmation Time |

| Binance Smart Chain (BNB) | 1-5 minutes |  

**Note**: Network congestion can affect processing times. Always check blockchain explorer confirmations for critical transfers.  

## Frequently Asked Questions
