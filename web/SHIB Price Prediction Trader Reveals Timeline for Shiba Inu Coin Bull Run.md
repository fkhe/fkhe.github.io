| September 2021  | Bull run acceleration                                                      | $0.00000698 - $0.00008845 |

### Lessons from the 2021 Bull Run
The 2021 surge saw SHIB climb to $0.00003532 before an 80% correction to $0.00000698. However, the token rebounded strongly in Q4 2021, reaching an all-time high of $0.00008845. This pattern suggests that prolonged consolidation periods often precede significant breakouts.
