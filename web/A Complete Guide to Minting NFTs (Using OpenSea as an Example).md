## Understanding NFT Minting

**NFT minting** transforms digital files (art, music, videos) into verifiable blockchain assets. Unlike traditional digital sales, NFTs use **Ethereum** or **Polygon** blockchains to guarantee ownership and enable royalty tracking. Key benefits include:

- **Immutable ownership**: Your creator credentials are permanently recorded.
- **Passive income**: Earn royalties (typically 5â€“10%) on secondary sales.
- **Market access**: Tap into a global audience of collectors and investors.

Before diving into steps, ensure you understand core terms like **crypto wallets**, **gas fees**, and **blockchain protocols**.
