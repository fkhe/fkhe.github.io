# OKLink and CertiK Forge Strategic Partnership to Standardize Freeze Asset Requests in Web3.0  

The blockchain industry took a significant step toward enhanced security and compliance at the **Meta Era Summit 2023** during Token 2049 in Singapore. **OKLink**, a leading Web3.0 data and compliance solutions provider under **OKX**, and **CertiK**, a pioneer in Web3.0 security, announced a strategic partnership to develop standardized protocols for **Freeze Asset Requests (FAR)**. This initiative aims to streamline asset recovery processes, reduce response times during security breaches, and establish a unified framework for safeguarding digital assets.

## Strategic Collaboration to Enhance Web3.0 Security  

Under this partnership, OKLink and CertiK will work together to create a technical standard for FAR, enabling faster and more efficient freezing of stolen funds. Currently, cryptocurrency exchanges operate under disparate procedures for handling asset lock requests, leading to communication delays and missed recovery opportunities. By introducing a universal fund-locking mechanism, the collaboration seeks to:  
- **Standardize technical requirements** for asset freezes  
- **Accelerate incident response** during security breaches  
- **Improve cross-industry coordination** between exchanges, security firms, and affected parties  

**Key Focus Areas**:  
1. **Risk Control & Compliance Data**: Joint efforts to establish data labeling standards and streamline information-sharing protocols.  
2. **Interoperability**: Developing a common language for tracking and investigating illicit activities across blockchain networks.

## Industry Leaders Weigh In on Web3.0 Safety  

During a high-profile panel discussion titled *"Elevating Web3.0 Security for Users"*, executives from OKLink, CertiK, and academia highlighted the urgency of collaborative action.  

### OKLink CEO: A Call for Unified Standards  
**Ren Yuning**, CEO of OKLink, emphasized the fragmented nature of current asset recovery practices:  
*"Each exchange has its own process for handling stolen funds, creating inefficiencies that jeopardize recovery. By establishing a universal fund-locking standard, we can create a win-win scenario where victims and platforms work together seamlessly to protect assets."*  

Ren underscored OKLinkâ€™s blockchain analytics capabilities as a critical enabler of this initiative, noting the companyâ€™s ability to process over **300 billion on-chain transactions** across **170+ blockchain networks**.  

### CertiK CTO: Building Safer Ecosystems  
**Dr. Kang Li**, Chief Security Officer at CertiK, shared insights on the companyâ€™s track record:  
*"Since 2022, CertiK has detected over **1,100 security incidents** involving $4.8 billion in losses. Our SaaS platform monitors **2+ billion wallets and smart contracts**, providing real-time risk assessments for nearly 12,000 projects. This partnership with OKLink will amplify our ability to protect digital assets through standardized protocols."*

## Technical Innovations Driving the Partnership  

### 1. Freeze Asset Request (FAR) Standardization  
The FAR initiative addresses three critical challenges:  
- **Diverse Technical Requirements**: Exchanges currently demand varying documentation formats for asset freezes.  
- **Time-Critical Recovery**: Stolen funds often disappear within hours due to slow response times.  
- **Cross-Platform Coordination**: Lack of interoperability between blockchain networks and security tools.  

### 2. Universal Transaction Labeling System  
Both companies are developing a **data labeling framework** to unify investigative tags across blockchain analytics providers. This system will:  
- Create a shared vocabulary for tracking illicit activities  
- Enhance collaboration between security teams and law enforcement  
- Improve accuracy in identifying high-risk addresses
