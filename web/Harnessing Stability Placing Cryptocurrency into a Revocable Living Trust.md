## Why Cryptocurrency Needs Specialized Estate Planning  

Cryptocurrencies differ from traditional assets due to their:  
| **Characteristic**       | **Implication for Estate Planning**                     |  
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|  
| Decentralized nature     | No central authority to recover lost keys.              |  
| Volatility               | Valuation at death may impact tax liabilities.          |  
| Pseudonymous ownership   | Difficulty proving ownership without proper records.    |  

Failure to address these factors could result in irreversible asset loss or disputes among heirs.
