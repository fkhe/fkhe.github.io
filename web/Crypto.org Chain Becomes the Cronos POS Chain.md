# Crypto.org Chain Becomes the Cronos POS Chain  

The rebranding of **Crypto.org Chain** into **Cronos POS Chain** marks a pivotal moment for the Cosmos ecosystem. This transition, effective October 16, 2023, aligns the blockchain network with the broader Cronos ecosystem, enhancing coherence for users, developers, and partners. By consolidating under the **Cronos** brand, the network aims to streamline its role as a foundational layer for decentralized applications (dApps), payments, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  

This article explores the **Cronos POS Chain**, its integration into the Cronos ecosystem, the phased rebranding process, and the implications for the future of blockchain technology.

## Understanding the Cronos Ecosystem  

The Cronos ecosystem comprises three core components:  
1. **Cronos ($CRO)**: The native utility token powering transactions, staking, and governance.  
2. **Cronos POS Chain**: A high-performance Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain serving as the ecosystemâ€™s "layer zero" security foundation.  
3. **Cronos EVM Chain**: An Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain hosting over 500 dApps and $300M in DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL).  

By unifying these components under a single brand, the Cronos ecosystem simplifies navigation for users and developers while fostering cross-chain collaboration.

## Why the Rebranding?  

The rebranding addresses the need for a cohesive user experience and technical synergy between the **Cronos POS Chain** and **Cronos EVM Chain**. Both chains share:  
- **Common Mission**: Accelerating cryptocurrency adoption through low-cost, high-speed transactions.  
- **Shared Tokenomics**: The $CRO token facilitates staking, governance, and transaction fees across both chains.  
- **Interoperability**: Leveraging Cosmos SDK modules like IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) and Inter-Chain Accounts to enable seamless asset transfers.  

This alignment positions Cronos as a multi-layered ecosystem bridging the Cosmos and Ethereum universes, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second.

## Key Features of the Cronos POS Chain  

As a top 3 Cosmos chain by Total Value Staked (TVS), the **Cronos POS Chain** offers:  
- **Ultra-Low Fees**: Transaction costs average $0.00001, ideal for micropayments and NFTs.  
- **Security**: Secured by over 100 validators representing ~$350M in staked assets.  
- **Scalability**: Processes ~33 million transactions to date, with a focus on mainstream adoption.  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built on the Cosmos SDK, enabling integration with IBC, Inter-Chain Security, and other innovations.  

### Real-World Applications  

The Cronos POS Chain powers critical services like **Crypto.com Pay** and **Crypto.com NFT**, serving 80 million global users. It also partners with industry leaders like **Ledger**, **Coinbase**, and **Alchemy** to expand its reach.

## Phased Rebranding Process  

The transition from **Crypto.org Chain** to **Cronos POS Chain** follows a structured three-phase approach:  

| Phase | Timeline          | Key Actions                              |  
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| 1     | October 16, 2023  | Launch of new domains (cronos-pos.org)   |  
| 2     | Octoberâ€“January 2024 | Gradual URL updates and redirects      |  
| 3     | March 2024        | Deprecation of crypto.org domains        |  

### Domain Changes  

- **Main Website**: [cronos-pos.org](https://cronos-pos.org)  
- **Documentation**: [docs.cronos-pos.org](https://docs.cronos-pos.org)  
- **Block Explorers**: Updated to reflect the new domain.  

Old URLs will redirect temporarily, but users should update bookmarks by January 2024.
