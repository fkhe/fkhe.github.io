# Grayscale Completes Reverse Stock Splits for Bitcoin and Ethereum Mini Trust ETFs

Grayscale Investments, a pioneering crypto asset manager with over a decade of experience offering 25+ crypto investment products, has finalized the reverse share splits for its Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (NYSE Arca: BTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (NYSE Arca: ETH). This strategic move, effective 5:00 PM Eastern Time on November 19, 2024, aims to enhance market accessibility while maintaining investment value integrity.

## Reverse Stock Split Mechanics Explained

The restructuring adjusts share prices while preserving total portfolio value. For Bitcoin holders, shares now trade at 5Ã— their pre-split net asset value (NAV), with a proportional 80% reduction in outstanding shares. Ethereum investors see an even more pronounced adjustment - shares now reflect 10Ã— their original NAV, accompanied by a 90% decrease in available shares.

This table illustrates the fundamental mathematics behind reverse stock splits:

| Period      | Shares Owned | Hypothetical NAV | Total Value |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Pre-Split   | 500          | $2.00           | $1,000      |
| Post-Split  | 100          | $10.00          | $1,000      |

*Bitcoin 1:5 Split Example*

| Period      | Shares Owned | Hypothetical NAV | Total Value |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Pre-Split   | 1,000        | $1.00           | $1,000      |
| Post-Split  | 100          | $10.00          | $1,000      |

*Ethereum 1:10 Split Example*

## Regulatory Framework and Investor Considerations

These investment vehicles operate outside the Investment Company Act of 1940 regulations. While this structure offers unique advantages in crypto markets, it also means investors don't receive the same protections as traditional ETFs. Key implications include:

- **Market Volatility Exposure**: Direct crypto price fluctuations impact fund performance
- **Liquidity Management**: Fractional shares from the split require special handling
- **Trading Mechanics**: Post-split shares continue trading under existing tickers "BTC" and "ETH" on NYSE Arca

## Fractional Share Management

Investors holding fractional shares following the split have two resolution pathways:

1. **Internal Tracking**: Depository Trust Company (DTC) participants may maintain fractional positions on internal ledgers
2. **Automated Liquidation**: DTC can aggregate fractional shares, execute market sales, and distribute cash proceeds proportionally

CUSIP number updates now reflect the restructuring:
- Bitcoin Mini Trust: 389930 207
- Ethereum Mini Trust: 38964R 203

## Strategic Market Positioning

This corporate action aligns with broader industry trends toward institutional-grade crypto investment products. By adjusting share pricing structures, Grayscale enhances accessibility for traditional investors while maintaining the fundamental economic position of existing shareholders.

## Risk Disclosure and Investment Suitability

Digital asset investments carry unique risks requiring careful consideration:
- **Total Loss Potential**: Not suitable for risk-averse investors
- **Indirect Exposure**: Funds represent crypto price exposure rather than direct ownership
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Evolving compliance landscape requires ongoing monitoring
